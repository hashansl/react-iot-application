# Real-time IoT dashboard

This is a real-time dashboard built with React and AWS Amplify. This allows the visualization of data as it is generated, providing up-to-the-minute insights into key metrics. The dashboard is designed to automatically update as data is received, allowing users to track changes and trends in real-time. React provides a flexible and responsive front-end framework, enabling the dashboard to display data in a variety of formats, such as graphs, charts, and tables. AWS Amplify simplifies the backend infrastructure, providing a scalable and secure solution for data storage and retrieval, as well as integrating with various services such as AWS IoT for real-time data streams. Together, React and AWS Amplify offer a powerful solution for building real-time dashboards that are both visually appealing and highly functional, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.
